HOW TO RUN:
* Open "Project Files" folder and run "main.py"
* Output Samples are added in "Output Samples" folder
* I have Added some .txt files rather than adding Screenshots due to lack of space and taking 2-3 screenshots.
* I have added AddressBook.txt as a sample that contains some sample data which works, but if there is no file program creates a sample file on the start automatically.


HOW IT WORKS:
* AddressBook has a Control that shows all the Cool things you can do with it.
* DATABASE:
	AddressBook has its on LIST OF DICTIONARIES which is fetched from the AddressBook.txt file(if any) on the object creation and saved on the same file on exit(after asking user).
* Program displays all feature and asks for a choice to execute it.
* Everytime a wrong input is entered Program KEEP ASKING UNTIL THE VAlID INPUT IS ENTERED.
* Inside every sub-menu, There is a "Back to Menu" option.
* ON EXIT PROGRAM ASKS IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE MODIFIED DATA OR NOT.
* Data is saved on AddressBook.txt file.
